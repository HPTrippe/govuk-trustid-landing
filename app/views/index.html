        The GDS Digital Identity programme wants to make it easier for teams across government to check who their users are when they access services.</p>
      <p class="hero__description" style="color:white">
        We're designing a new service to help teams do these checks. To make sure we build the right thing, we want to talk to service teams from different departments and agencies. If you work on one of these teams and are involved in making sure only the right users have access to your service, then we'd like to talk to you.</p>

              proving their identities
